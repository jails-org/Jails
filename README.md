## 🕶 Motivation

Jails was created to add a minimal layer of abstraction to build components for web applications without moving away from web standards and bringing good old technics to address complexities from modern apps.

- **Decoupled** - Back-end agnostic, can be used with any back-end framework or language, does not import styles and does not mix html in the code.
- **Lightweight** - It's a very lightweight library (~9kb gzipped) and it makes your application progressively lite by keeping html away from your javascript code and therefore smaller bundles.
- **interoperable** - It can be integrated and work with any other vanilla ui or behavioral libraries, so you don't have to wait for a Jails chartjs library in order to use, just integrate it in your app without pain.

## 🎥 Best Scenarios to use
Jails is better suited for:
        
#### Server Site Rendered ( SSR )

- Wordpress
- Laravel
- Ruby on Rails
- Node Backend with a Template System:
  - Pug, Liquid, Nunjucks, Handlebars etc.

#### Static Site Generated ( SSG

- Hugo
- Astro
- Jekill
  ...etc

... Any site you can add a script tag on it =). So if you already have a engine that renders your html, Jails can be a good way to create an elegant event driven system.
